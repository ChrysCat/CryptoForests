# CryptoForests
## Blockchain for Green Contracts
Our world is losing its forest cover and greenery at an unprecedented rate. While firms are willing to offset their carbon footprint by purchasing carbon credits, the carbon credit market is almost non-existent in many places in the world. One method of carbon offsetting is by planting or maintaining trees, which naturally exist in rural and remote parts of the world. If we can direct the funds to communities or incentive them for reforesting or maintaining the green cover, we benefit the communities, and help restore the world’s forest cover. 
## Workflow
1.	Vendors: Vendors list the following information in a green contract:
    -	GPS location, cost of planting and maintaining a tree and number of trees that can be planted.
    -	GPS location, existing trees, their size, age, and cost of maintaining them per year.
2.	Validators: Validators review the items and give them a carbon credit rating. Validators receive a small flat fee for rating the items.
3.	Green contract: Validated and unvalidated contracts are listed for sale. Each contract has a GPS location, type (fresh planting or existing), price, validity period and terms of contract – monthly, quarterly, or annual payment. 
4.	Buyers can buy both validated and unvalidated contracts. Vendors upload proof of their work via:
    -	GPS tagged photograph of land that is planted as per the contract.
    -	GPS tagged photograph of existing trees at the end of each contract period. 
5.	If the buyer accepts the proof of work and is satisfied, funds are released as per the contract. Buyers can hire validators to validate the proof of work if they purchase many contracts and wish to outsource validation. If the buyer is not satisfied, the remaining part of contract is cancelled and vendor gets a poor rating.
6.	At the end of contract period, the contracts are available for purchase by other buyers.
7.	Buyers can rate the vendors. Highly rated vendors contracts could be sold for a higher premium, incentivizing communities to grow or conserve their forest cover.
